        <p>I did not realize the ignominious position of respectable poverty till I went to
            <company>Ellinger's cloak factory</company>, <address type="exact">282 Madison
                street</address>, <description>where labor is bondage, the laborer a slave, and
                    flesh and blood cheaper than needles and thread</description>. Corporations said to
            be without heart, but this concern is a commercial inquisition. <description>It puts its
                help on the plane of slavery and nothing but civil law prevents the use of the
                lash</description>.</p>
        <p>The factory is on the <description>third floor of the large brick building at the
            <address type="general">east end of Madison street bridge on the south side of
                the street</address></description>. Elevator? Not much. <description>An elevator
                    is a luxury and luxuries have no place at
                    <company>Ellinger's</company>.</description> You will be short of breath when you
            reach the top of the fourth flight, but in recovering you have time to take in the
            surroundings -- <description>a great barn of a place, with the single charm of good,
                light. There is plenty of vacant room, but the women are huddled together, elbows
                touching, along the line of machines. Beneath the west windows flows the river; at
                the south end of the room, not ten feet from the crowded table, is a tier of
                closets, and on hot days the combined odor of the two is
                shocking.</description><description>Nobody in his employ dare complain about smells,
                    cold, heat, work, wages, or rules</description>. But whoever heard of martyrs
            complaining?</p>
