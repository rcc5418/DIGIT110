  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>From fairest creatures we desire increase,
    <LB number="2"/>That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
    <LB number="3"/>But as the riper should by time decease,
    <LB number="4"/>His tender heir might bear his memory:
    <LB number="5"/>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
    <LB number="6"/>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
    <LB number="7"/>Making a famine where abundance lies,
    <LB number="8"/>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
    <LB number="9"/>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
    <LB number="10"/>And only herald to the gaudy spring,
    <LB number="11"/>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
    <LB number="12"/>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
    <LB number="13"/>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
    <LB number="14"/>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
    <LB number="2"/>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
    <LB number="3"/>Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
    <LB number="4"/>Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
    <LB number="5"/>Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
    <LB number="6"/>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
    <LB number="7"/>To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
    <LB number="8"/>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
    <LB number="9"/>How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
    <LB number="10"/>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
    <LB number="11"/>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
    <LB number="12"/>Proving his beauty by succession thine!
    <LB number="13"/>This were to be new made when thou art old,
    <LB number="14"/>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
    <LB number="2"/>Now is the time that face should form another;
    <LB number="3"/>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
    <LB number="4"/>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
    <LB number="5"/>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
    <LB number="6"/>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
    <LB number="7"/>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
    <LB number="8"/>Of his self-love to stop posterity?
    <LB number="9"/>Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
    <LB number="10"/>Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
    <LB number="11"/>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
    <LB number="12"/>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
    <LB number="13"/>But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
    <LB number="14"/>Die single and thine image dies with thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
    <LB number="2"/>Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
    <LB number="3"/>Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
    <LB number="4"/>And being frank she lends to those are free:
    <LB number="5"/>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
    <LB number="6"/>The bounteous largess given thee to give?
    <LB number="7"/>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
    <LB number="8"/>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
    <LB number="9"/>For having traffic with thy self alone,
    <LB number="10"/>Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
    <LB number="11"/>Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
    <LB number="12"/>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
    <LB number="13"/>Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
    <LB number="14"/>Which, used, lives th' executor to be.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
    <LB number="2"/>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
    <LB number="3"/>Will play the tyrants to the very same
    <LB number="4"/>And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
    <LB number="5"/>For never-resting time leads summer on
    <LB number="6"/>To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
    <LB number="7"/>Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
    <LB number="8"/>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
    <LB number="9"/>Then were not summer's distillation left,
    <LB number="10"/>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
    <LB number="11"/>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
    <LB number="12"/>Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
    <LB number="13"/>But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
    <LB number="14"/>Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
    <LB number="2"/>In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
    <LB number="3"/>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
    <LB number="4"/>With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.
    <LB number="5"/>That use is not forbidden usury,
    <LB number="6"/>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
    <LB number="7"/>That's for thy self to breed another thee,
    <LB number="8"/>Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
    <LB number="9"/>Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
    <LB number="10"/>If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
    <LB number="11"/>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
    <LB number="12"/>Leaving thee living in posterity?
    <LB number="13"/>Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
    <LB number="14"/>To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
    <LB number="2"/>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
    <LB number="3"/>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
    <LB number="4"/>Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
    <LB number="5"/>And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
    <LB number="6"/>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
    <LB number="7"/>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
    <LB number="8"/>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
    <LB number="9"/>But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
    <LB number="10"/>Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
    <LB number="11"/>The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
    <LB number="12"/>From his low tract, and look another way:
    <LB number="13"/>So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:
    <LB number="14"/>Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
    <LB number="2"/>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
    <LB number="3"/>Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
    <LB number="4"/>Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
    <LB number="5"/>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
    <LB number="6"/>By unions married, do offend thine ear,
    <LB number="7"/>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
    <LB number="8"/>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
    <LB number="9"/>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
    <LB number="10"/>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
    <LB number="11"/>Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
    <LB number="12"/>Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
    <LB number="13"/>Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
    <LB number="14"/>Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
    <LB number="2"/>That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
    <LB number="3"/>Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
    <LB number="4"/>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
    <LB number="5"/>The world will be thy widow and still weep
    <LB number="6"/>That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
    <LB number="7"/>When every private widow well may keep
    <LB number="8"/>By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
    <LB number="9"/>Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
    <LB number="10"/>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
    <LB number="11"/>But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
    <LB number="12"/>And kept unused the user so destroys it.
    <LB number="13"/>No love toward others in that bosom sits
    <LB number="14"/>That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
    <LB number="2"/>Who for thy self art so unprovident.
    <LB number="3"/>Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,
    <LB number="4"/>But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
    <LB number="5"/>For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,
    <LB number="6"/>That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
    <LB number="7"/>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
    <LB number="8"/>Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
    <LB number="9"/>O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
    <LB number="10"/>Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?
    <LB number="11"/>Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
    <LB number="12"/>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
    <LB number="13"/>Make thee another self for love of me,
    <LB number="14"/>That beauty still may live in thine or thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
    <LB number="2"/>In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
    <LB number="3"/>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
    <LB number="4"/>Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,
    <LB number="5"/>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
    <LB number="6"/>Without this folly, age, and cold decay:
    <LB number="7"/>If all were minded so, the times should cease
    <LB number="8"/>And threescore year would make the world away.
    <LB number="9"/>Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
    <LB number="10"/>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
    <LB number="11"/>Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
    <LB number="12"/>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
    <LB number="13"/>She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
    <LB number="14"/>Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When I do count the clock that tells the time,
    <LB number="2"/>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
    <LB number="3"/>When I behold the violet past prime,
    <LB number="4"/>And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;
    <LB number="5"/>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
    <LB number="6"/>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
    <LB number="7"/>And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
    <LB number="8"/>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
    <LB number="9"/>Then of thy beauty do I question make,
    <LB number="10"/>That thou among the wastes of time must go,
    <LB number="11"/>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
    <LB number="12"/>And die as fast as they see others grow;
    <LB number="13"/>And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
    <LB number="14"/>Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! that you were your self; but, love you are
    <LB number="2"/>No longer yours, than you your self here live:
    <LB number="3"/>Against this coming end you should prepare,
    <LB number="4"/>And your sweet semblance to some other give:
    <LB number="5"/>So should that beauty which you hold in lease
    <LB number="6"/>Find no determination; then you were
    <LB number="7"/>Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
    <LB number="8"/>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
    <LB number="9"/>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
    <LB number="10"/>Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
    <LB number="11"/>Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
    <LB number="12"/>And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
    <LB number="13"/>O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
    <LB number="14"/>You had a father: let your son say so.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
    <LB number="2"/>And yet methinks I have astronomy,
    <LB number="3"/>But not to tell of good or evil luck,
    <LB number="4"/>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
    <LB number="5"/>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
    <LB number="6"/>Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
    <LB number="7"/>Or say with princes if it shall go well
    <LB number="8"/>By oft predict that I in heaven find:
    <LB number="9"/>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
    <LB number="10"/>And constant stars in them I read such art
    <LB number="11"/>As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
    <LB number="12"/>If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';
    <LB number="13"/>Or else of thee this I prognosticate: 'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and
    date.' </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When I consider every thing that grows
    <LB number="2"/>Holds in perfection but a little moment,
    <LB number="3"/>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
    <LB number="4"/>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
    <LB number="5"/>When I perceive that men as plants increase,
    <LB number="6"/>Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,
    <LB number="7"/>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
    <LB number="8"/>And wear their brave state out of memory;
    <LB number="9"/>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
    <LB number="10"/>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
    <LB number="11"/>Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
    <LB number="12"/>To change your day of youth to sullied night,
    <LB number="13"/>And all in war with Time for love of you,
    <LB number="14"/>As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>But wherefore do not you a mightier way
    <LB number="2"/>Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
    <LB number="3"/>And fortify your self in your decay
    <LB number="4"/>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
    <LB number="5"/>Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
    <LB number="6"/>And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
    <LB number="7"/>With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
    <LB number="8"/>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
    <LB number="9"/>So should the lines of life that life repair,
    <LB number="10"/>Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
    <LB number="11"/>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
    <LB number="12"/>Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
    <LB number="13"/>To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
    <LB number="14"/>And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Who will believe my verse in time to come,
    <LB number="2"/>If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
    <LB number="3"/>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
    <LB number="4"/>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
    <LB number="5"/>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
    <LB number="6"/>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
    <LB number="7"/>The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
    <LB number="8"/>Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
    <LB number="9"/>So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,
    <LB number="10"/>Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
    <LB number="11"/>And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
    <LB number="12"/>And stretched metre of an antique song:
    <LB number="13"/>But were some child of yours alive that time,
    <LB number="14"/>You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    <LB number="2"/>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
    <LB number="3"/>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
    <LB number="4"/>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
    <LB number="5"/>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
    <LB number="6"/>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
    <LB number="7"/>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
    <LB number="8"/>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
    <LB number="9"/>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
    <LB number="10"/>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
    <LB number="11"/>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
    <LB number="12"/>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
    <LB number="13"/>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    <LB number="14"/>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
    <LB number="2"/>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
    <LB number="3"/>Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
    <LB number="4"/>And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;
    <LB number="5"/>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
    <LB number="6"/>And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
    <LB number="7"/>To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
    <LB number="8"/>But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
    <LB number="9"/>O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
    <LB number="10"/>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
    <LB number="11"/>Him in thy course untainted do allow
    <LB number="12"/>For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
    <LB number="13"/>Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
    <LB number="14"/>My love shall in my verse ever live young.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
    <LB number="2"/>Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
    <LB number="3"/>A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
    <LB number="4"/>With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:
    <LB number="5"/>An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
    <LB number="6"/>Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
    <LB number="7"/>A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
    <LB number="8"/>Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
    <LB number="9"/>And for a woman wert thou first created;
    <LB number="10"/>Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
    <LB number="11"/>And by addition me of thee defeated,
    <LB number="12"/>By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
    <LB number="13"/>But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
    <LB number="14"/>Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>So is it not with me as with that Muse,
    <LB number="2"/>Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
    <LB number="3"/>Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
    <LB number="4"/>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
    <LB number="5"/>Making a couplement of proud compare'
    <LB number="6"/>With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
    <LB number="7"/>With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
    <LB number="8"/>That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
    <LB number="9"/>O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
    <LB number="10"/>And then believe me, my love is as fair
    <LB number="11"/>As any mother's child, though not so bright
    <LB number="12"/>As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
    <LB number="13"/>Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
    <LB number="14"/>I will not praise that purpose not to sell.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
    <LB number="2"/>So long as youth and thou are of one date;
    <LB number="3"/>But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
    <LB number="4"/>Then look I death my days should expiate.
    <LB number="5"/>For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
    <LB number="6"/>Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
    <LB number="7"/>Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
    <LB number="8"/>How can I then be elder than thou art?
    <LB number="9"/>O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary
    <LB number="10"/>As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
    <LB number="11"/>Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
    <LB number="12"/>As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
    <LB number="13"/>Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
    <LB number="14"/>Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>As an unperfect actor on the stage,
    <LB number="2"/>Who with his fear is put beside his part,
    <LB number="3"/>Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
    <LB number="4"/>Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
    <LB number="5"/>So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
    <LB number="6"/>The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
    <LB number="7"/>And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
    <LB number="8"/>O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.
    <LB number="9"/>O! let my looks be then the eloquence
    <LB number="10"/>And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
    <LB number="11"/>Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
    <LB number="12"/>More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
    <LB number="13"/>O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
    <LB number="14"/>To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
    <LB number="2"/>Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
    <LB number="3"/>My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
    <LB number="4"/>And perspective it is best painter's art.
    <LB number="5"/>For through the painter must you see his skill,
    <LB number="6"/>To find where your true image pictur'd lies,
    <LB number="7"/>Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
    <LB number="8"/>That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
    <LB number="9"/>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
    <LB number="10"/>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
    <LB number="11"/>Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
    <LB number="12"/>Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
    <LB number="13"/>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
    <LB number="14"/>They draw but what they see, know not the heart.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Let those who are in favour with their stars
    <LB number="2"/>Of public honour and proud titles boast,
    <LB number="3"/>Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars
    <LB number="4"/>Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
    <LB number="5"/>Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
    <LB number="6"/>But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
    <LB number="7"/>And in themselves their pride lies buried,
    <LB number="8"/>For at a frown they in their glory die.
    <LB number="9"/>The painful warrior famoused for fight,
    <LB number="10"/>After a thousand victories once foil'd,
    <LB number="11"/>Is from the book of honour razed quite,
    <LB number="12"/>And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
    <LB number="13"/>Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
    <LB number="14"/>Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
    <LB number="2"/>Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
    <LB number="3"/>To thee I send this written embassage,
    <LB number="4"/>To witness duty, not to show my wit:
    <LB number="5"/>Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
    <LB number="6"/>May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
    <LB number="7"/>But that I hope some good conceit of thine
    <LB number="8"/>In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:
    <LB number="9"/>Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
    <LB number="10"/>Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
    <LB number="11"/>And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
    <LB number="12"/>To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
    <LB number="13"/>Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
    <LB number="14"/>Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
    <LB number="2"/>The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
    <LB number="3"/>But then begins a journey in my head
    <LB number="4"/>To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
    <LB number="5"/>For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
    <LB number="6"/>Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
    <LB number="7"/>And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
    <LB number="8"/>Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
    <LB number="9"/>Save that my soul's imaginary sight
    <LB number="10"/>Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
    <LB number="11"/>Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,
    <LB number="12"/>Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
    <LB number="13"/>Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
    <LB number="14"/>For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>How can I then return in happy plight,
    <LB number="2"/>That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?
    <LB number="3"/>When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,
    <LB number="4"/>But day by night and night by day oppress'd,
    <LB number="5"/>And each, though enemies to either's reign,
    <LB number="6"/>Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
    <LB number="7"/>The one by toil, the other to complain
    <LB number="8"/>How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
    <LB number="9"/>I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,
    <LB number="10"/>And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
    <LB number="11"/>So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
    <LB number="12"/>When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
    <LB number="13"/>But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
    <LB number="14"/>And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
    <LB number="2"/>I all alone beweep my outcast state,
    <LB number="3"/>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
    <LB number="4"/>And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
    <LB number="5"/>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
    <LB number="6"/>Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
    <LB number="7"/>Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
    <LB number="8"/>With what I most enjoy contented least;
    <LB number="9"/>Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
    <LB number="10"/>Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,
    <LB number="11"/>Like to the lark at break of day arising
    <LB number="12"/>From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
    <LB number="13"/>For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
    <LB number="14"/>That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
    <LB number="2"/>I summon up remembrance of things past,
    <LB number="3"/>I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
    <LB number="4"/>And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
    <LB number="5"/>Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
    <LB number="6"/>For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
    <LB number="7"/>And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
    <LB number="8"/>And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
    <LB number="9"/>Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
    <LB number="10"/>And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
    <LB number="11"/>The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
    <LB number="12"/>Which I new pay as if not paid before.
    <LB number="13"/>But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
    <LB number="14"/>All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
    <LB number="2"/>Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
    <LB number="3"/>And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
    <LB number="4"/>And all those friends which I thought buried.
    <LB number="5"/>How many a holy and obsequious tear
    <LB number="6"/>Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
    <LB number="7"/>As interest of the dead, which now appear
    <LB number="8"/>But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!
    <LB number="9"/>Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
    <LB number="10"/>Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
    <LB number="11"/>Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
    <LB number="12"/>That due of many now is thine alone:
    <LB number="13"/>Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
    <LB number="14"/>And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>If thou survive my well-contented day,
    <LB number="2"/>When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
    <LB number="3"/>And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
    <LB number="4"/>These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
    <LB number="5"/>Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
    <LB number="6"/>And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
    <LB number="7"/>Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
    <LB number="8"/>Exceeded by the height of happier men.
    <LB number="9"/>O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought: 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this
    growing age, <LB number="10"/>A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
    <LB number="11"/>To march in ranks of better equipage:
    <LB number="12"/>But since he died and poets better prove,
    <LB number="13"/>Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Full many a glorious morning have I seen
    <LB number="2"/>Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
    <LB number="3"/>Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
    <LB number="4"/>Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
    <LB number="5"/>Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
    <LB number="6"/>With ugly rack on his celestial face,
    <LB number="7"/>And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
    <LB number="8"/>Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
    <LB number="9"/>Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
    <LB number="10"/>With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
    <LB number="11"/>But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
    <LB number="12"/>The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
    <LB number="13"/>Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
    <LB number="14"/>Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
    <LB number="2"/>And make me travel forth without my cloak,
    <LB number="3"/>To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
    <LB number="4"/>Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke? 'Tis not enough that through the cloud
    thou break, <LB number="5"/>To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
    <LB number="6"/>For no man well of such a salve can speak,
    <LB number="7"/>That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
    <LB number="8"/>Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
    <LB number="9"/>Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
    <LB number="10"/>The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
    <LB number="11"/>To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
    <LB number="12"/>Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
    <LB number="13"/>And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
    <LB number="2"/>Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
    <LB number="3"/>Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
    <LB number="4"/>And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
    <LB number="5"/>All men make faults, and even I in this,
    <LB number="6"/>Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
    <LB number="7"/>Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
    <LB number="8"/>Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
    <LB number="9"/>For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--
    <LB number="10"/>Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--
    <LB number="11"/>And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
    <LB number="12"/>Such civil war is in my love and hate,
    <LB number="13"/>That I an accessary needs must be,
    <LB number="14"/>To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Let me confess that we two must be twain,
    <LB number="2"/>Although our undivided loves are one:
    <LB number="3"/>So shall those blots that do with me remain,
    <LB number="4"/>Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
    <LB number="5"/>In our two loves there is but one respect,
    <LB number="6"/>Though in our lives a separable spite,
    <LB number="7"/>Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
    <LB number="8"/>Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
    <LB number="9"/>I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
    <LB number="10"/>Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
    <LB number="11"/>Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
    <LB number="12"/>Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    <LB number="13"/>But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    <LB number="14"/>As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>As a decrepit father takes delight
    <LB number="2"/>To see his active child do deeds of youth,
    <LB number="3"/>So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
    <LB number="4"/>Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
    <LB number="5"/>For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
    <LB number="6"/>Or any of these all, or all, or more,
    <LB number="7"/>Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
    <LB number="8"/>I make my love engrafted, to this store:
    <LB number="9"/>So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
    <LB number="10"/>Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
    <LB number="11"/>That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
    <LB number="12"/>And by a part of all thy glory live.
    <LB number="13"/>Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
    <LB number="14"/>This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>How can my muse want subject to invent,
    <LB number="2"/>While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
    <LB number="3"/>Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
    <LB number="4"/>For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
    <LB number="5"/>O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
    <LB number="6"/>Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
    <LB number="7"/>For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
    <LB number="8"/>When thou thy self dost give invention light?
    <LB number="9"/>Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
    <LB number="10"/>Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
    <LB number="11"/>And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
    <LB number="12"/>Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    <LB number="13"/>If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    <LB number="14"/>The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
    <LB number="2"/>When thou art all the better part of me?
    <LB number="3"/>What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
    <LB number="4"/>And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
    <LB number="5"/>Even for this, let us divided live,
    <LB number="6"/>And our dear love lose name of single one,
    <LB number="7"/>That by this separation I may give
    <LB number="8"/>That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
    <LB number="9"/>O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
    <LB number="10"/>Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
    <LB number="11"/>To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
    <LB number="12"/>Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
    <LB number="13"/>And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    <LB number="14"/>By praising him here who doth hence remain.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
    <LB number="2"/>What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
    <LB number="3"/>No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
    <LB number="4"/>All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.
    <LB number="5"/>Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,
    <LB number="6"/>I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;
    <LB number="7"/>But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest
    <LB number="8"/>By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
    <LB number="9"/>I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
    <LB number="10"/>Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
    <LB number="11"/>And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
    <LB number="12"/>To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.
    <LB number="13"/>Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    <LB number="14"/>Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
    <LB number="2"/>When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
    <LB number="3"/>Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
    <LB number="4"/>For still temptation follows where thou art.
    <LB number="5"/>Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
    <LB number="6"/>Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;
    <LB number="7"/>And when a woman woos, what woman's son
    <LB number="8"/>Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?
    <LB number="9"/>Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
    <LB number="10"/>And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
    <LB number="11"/>Who lead thee in their riot even there
    <LB number="12"/>Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--
    <LB number="13"/>Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
    <LB number="14"/>Thine by thy beauty being false to me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
    <LB number="2"/>And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
    <LB number="3"/>That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
    <LB number="4"/>A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
    <LB number="5"/>Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
    <LB number="6"/>Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
    <LB number="7"/>And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
    <LB number="8"/>Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
    <LB number="9"/>If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
    <LB number="10"/>And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
    <LB number="11"/>Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
    <LB number="12"/>And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
    <LB number="13"/>But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
    <LB number="14"/>Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
    <LB number="2"/>For all the day they view things unrespected;
    <LB number="3"/>But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
    <LB number="4"/>And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
    <LB number="5"/>Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
    <LB number="6"/>How would thy shadow's form form happy show
    <LB number="7"/>To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
    <LB number="8"/>When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
    <LB number="9"/>How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
    <LB number="10"/>By looking on thee in the living day,
    <LB number="11"/>When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
    <LB number="12"/>Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
    <LB number="13"/>All days are nights to see till I see thee,
    <LB number="14"/>And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
    <LB number="2"/>Injurious distance should not stop my way;
    <LB number="3"/>For then despite of space I would be brought,
    <LB number="4"/>From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
    <LB number="5"/>No matter then although my foot did stand
    <LB number="6"/>Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;
    <LB number="7"/>For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
    <LB number="8"/>As soon as think the place where he would be.
    <LB number="9"/>But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
    <LB number="10"/>To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
    <LB number="11"/>But that so much of earth and water wrought,
    <LB number="12"/>I must attend time's leisure with my moan;
    <LB number="13"/>Receiving nought by elements so slow
    <LB number="14"/>But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>The other two, slight air, and purging fire
    <LB number="2"/>Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
    <LB number="3"/>The first my thought, the other my desire,
    <LB number="4"/>These present-absent with swift motion slide.
    <LB number="5"/>For when these quicker elements are gone
    <LB number="6"/>In tender embassy of love to thee,
    <LB number="7"/>My life, being made of four, with two alone
    <LB number="8"/>Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
    <LB number="9"/>Until life's composition be recur'd
    <LB number="10"/>By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
    <LB number="11"/>Who even but now come back again, assur'd,
    <LB number="12"/>Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
    <LB number="13"/>This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
    <LB number="14"/>I send them back again, and straight grow sad.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
    <LB number="2"/>How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
    <LB number="3"/>Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
    <LB number="4"/>My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
    <LB number="5"/>My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--
    <LB number="6"/>A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--
    <LB number="7"/>But the defendant doth that plea deny,
    <LB number="8"/>And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
    <LB number="9"/>To side this title is impannelled
    <LB number="10"/>A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;
    <LB number="11"/>And by their verdict is determined
    <LB number="12"/>The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:
    <LB number="13"/>As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
    <LB number="14"/>And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
    <LB number="2"/>And each doth good turns now unto the other:
    <LB number="3"/>When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
    <LB number="4"/>Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
    <LB number="5"/>With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
    <LB number="6"/>And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
    <LB number="7"/>Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
    <LB number="8"/>And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
    <LB number="9"/>So, either by thy picture or my love,
    <LB number="10"/>Thy self away, art present still with me;
    <LB number="11"/>For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
    <LB number="12"/>And I am still with them, and they with thee;
    <LB number="13"/>Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
    <LB number="14"/>Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>How careful was I when I took my way,
    <LB number="2"/>Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
    <LB number="3"/>That to my use it might unused stay
    <LB number="4"/>From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
    <LB number="5"/>But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
    <LB number="6"/>Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
    <LB number="7"/>Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
    <LB number="8"/>Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
    <LB number="9"/>Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
    <LB number="10"/>Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
    <LB number="11"/>Within the gentle closure of my breast,
    <LB number="12"/>From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
    <LB number="13"/>And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
    <LB number="14"/>For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Against that time, if ever that time come,
    <LB number="2"/>When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
    <LB number="3"/>When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
    <LB number="4"/>Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;
    <LB number="5"/>Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
    <LB number="6"/>And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,
    <LB number="7"/>When love, converted from the thing it was,
    <LB number="8"/>Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
    <LB number="9"/>Against that time do I ensconce me here,
    <LB number="10"/>Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
    <LB number="11"/>And this my hand, against my self uprear,
    <LB number="12"/>To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
    <LB number="13"/>To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
    <LB number="14"/>Since why to love I can allege no cause.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>How heavy do I journey on the way,
    <LB number="2"/>When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
    <LB number="3"/>Doth teach that ease and that repose to say, 'Thus far the miles are measured from
    thy friend!' <LB number="4"/>The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
    <LB number="5"/>Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
    <LB number="6"/>As if by some instinct the wretch did know
    <LB number="7"/>His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:
    <LB number="8"/>The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
    <LB number="9"/>That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
    <LB number="10"/>Which heavily he answers with a groan,
    <LB number="11"/>More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
    <LB number="12"/>For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
    <LB number="13"/>My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
    <LB number="2"/>Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
    <LB number="3"/>From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
    <LB number="4"/>Till I return, of posting is no need.
    <LB number="5"/>O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
    <LB number="6"/>When swift extremity can seem but slow?
    <LB number="7"/>Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
    <LB number="8"/>In winged speed no motion shall I know,
    <LB number="9"/>Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
    <LB number="10"/>Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
    <LB number="11"/>Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
    <LB number="12"/>But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,-- 'Since from thee going, he went
    wilful-slow, <LB number="13"/>Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,
    <LB number="2"/>Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
    <LB number="3"/>The which he will not every hour survey,
    <LB number="4"/>For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
    <LB number="5"/>Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
    <LB number="6"/>Since, seldom coming in that long year set,
    <LB number="7"/>Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
    <LB number="8"/>Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
    <LB number="9"/>So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
    <LB number="10"/>Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
    <LB number="11"/>To make some special instant special-blest,
    <LB number="12"/>By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
    <LB number="13"/>Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
    <LB number="14"/>Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>What is your substance, whereof are you made,
    <LB number="2"/>That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
    <LB number="3"/>Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
    <LB number="4"/>And you but one, can every shadow lend.
    <LB number="5"/>Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
    <LB number="6"/>Is poorly imitated after you;
    <LB number="7"/>On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
    <LB number="8"/>And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
    <LB number="9"/>Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
    <LB number="10"/>The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
    <LB number="11"/>The other as your bounty doth appear;
    <LB number="12"/>And you in every blessed shape we know.
    <LB number="13"/>In all external grace you have some part,
    <LB number="14"/>But you like none, none you, for constant heart.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
    <LB number="2"/>By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
    <LB number="3"/>The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
    <LB number="4"/>For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
    <LB number="5"/>The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
    <LB number="6"/>As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
    <LB number="7"/>Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
    <LB number="8"/>When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
    <LB number="9"/>But, for their virtue only is their show,
    <LB number="10"/>They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;
    <LB number="11"/>Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
    <LB number="12"/>Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
    <LB number="13"/>And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    <LB number="14"/>When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
    <LB number="2"/>Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
    <LB number="3"/>But you shall shine more bright in these contents
    <LB number="4"/>Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.
    <LB number="5"/>When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
    <LB number="6"/>And broils root out the work of masonry,
    <LB number="7"/>Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
    <LB number="8"/>The living record of your memory.
    <LB number="9"/>'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
    <LB number="10"/>Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
    <LB number="11"/>Even in the eyes of all posterity
    <LB number="12"/>That wear this world out to the ending doom.
    <LB number="13"/>So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
    <LB number="14"/>You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
    <LB number="2"/>Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
    <LB number="3"/>Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
    <LB number="4"/>To-morrow sharpened in his former might:
    <LB number="5"/>So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
    <LB number="6"/>Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
    <LB number="7"/>To-morrow see again, and do not kill
    <LB number="8"/>The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
    <LB number="9"/>Let this sad interim like the ocean be
    <LB number="10"/>Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
    <LB number="11"/>Come daily to the banks, that when they see
    <LB number="12"/>Return of love, more blest may be the view;
    <LB number="13"/>Or call it winter, which being full of care,
    <LB number="14"/>Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Being your slave what should I do but tend,
    <LB number="2"/>Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
    <LB number="3"/>I have no precious time at all to spend;
    <LB number="4"/>Nor services to do, till you require.
    <LB number="5"/>Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
    <LB number="6"/>Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
    <LB number="7"/>Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
    <LB number="8"/>When you have bid your servant once adieu;
    <LB number="9"/>Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
    <LB number="10"/>Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
    <LB number="11"/>But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
    <LB number="12"/>Save, where you are, how happy you make those.
    <LB number="13"/>So true a fool is love, that in your will,
    <LB number="14"/>Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
    <LB number="2"/>I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
    <LB number="3"/>Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
    <LB number="4"/>Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
    <LB number="5"/>O! let me suffer, being at your beck,
    <LB number="6"/>The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
    <LB number="7"/>And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
    <LB number="8"/>Without accusing you of injury.
    <LB number="9"/>Be where you list, your charter is so strong
    <LB number="10"/>That you yourself may privilage your time
    <LB number="11"/>To what you will; to you it doth belong
    <LB number="12"/>Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
    <LB number="13"/>I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
    <LB number="14"/>Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>If there be nothing new, but that which is
    <LB number="2"/>Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,
    <LB number="3"/>Which labouring for invention bear amiss
    <LB number="4"/>The second burthen of a former child!
    <LB number="5"/>O! that record could with a backward look,
    <LB number="6"/>Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
    <LB number="7"/>Show me your image in some antique book,
    <LB number="8"/>Since mind at first in character was done!
    <LB number="9"/>That I might see what the old world could say
    <LB number="10"/>To this composed wonder of your frame;
    <LB number="11"/>Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,
    <LB number="12"/>Or whether revolution be the same.
    <LB number="13"/>O! sure I am the wits of former days,
    <LB number="14"/>To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
    <LB number="2"/>So do our minutes hasten to their end;
    <LB number="3"/>Each changing place with that which goes before,
    <LB number="4"/>In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
    <LB number="5"/>Nativity, once in the main of light,
    <LB number="6"/>Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
    <LB number="7"/>Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
    <LB number="8"/>And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
    <LB number="9"/>Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
    <LB number="10"/>And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
    <LB number="11"/>Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
    <LB number="12"/>And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
    <LB number="13"/>And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.
    <LB number="14"/>Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
    <LB number="2"/>My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
    <LB number="3"/>Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
    <LB number="4"/>While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
    <LB number="5"/>Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
    <LB number="6"/>So far from home into my deeds to pry,
    <LB number="7"/>To find out shames and idle hours in me,
    <LB number="8"/>The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
    <LB number="9"/>O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
    <LB number="10"/>It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
    <LB number="11"/>Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
    <LB number="12"/>To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
    <LB number="13"/>For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
    <LB number="14"/>From me far off, with others all too near.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
    <LB number="2"/>And all my soul, and all my every part;
    <LB number="3"/>And for this sin there is no remedy,
    <LB number="4"/>It is so grounded inward in my heart.
    <LB number="5"/>Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
    <LB number="6"/>No shape so true, no truth of such account;
    <LB number="7"/>And for myself mine own worth do define,
    <LB number="8"/>As I all other in all worths surmount.
    <LB number="9"/>But when my glass shows me myself indeed
    <LB number="10"/>Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
    <LB number="11"/>Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
    <LB number="12"/>Self so self-loving were iniquity.
    <LB number="13"/>'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,
    <LB number="14"/>Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Against my love shall be as I am now,
    <LB number="2"/>With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
    <LB number="3"/>When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
    <LB number="4"/>With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
    <LB number="5"/>Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
    <LB number="6"/>And all those beauties whereof now he's king
    <LB number="7"/>Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
    <LB number="8"/>Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
    <LB number="9"/>For such a time do I now fortify
    <LB number="10"/>Against confounding age's cruel knife,
    <LB number="11"/>That he shall never cut from memory
    <LB number="12"/>My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
    <LB number="13"/>His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
    <LB number="14"/>And they shall live, and he in them still green.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
    <LB number="2"/>The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
    <LB number="3"/>When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,
    <LB number="4"/>And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
    <LB number="5"/>When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
    <LB number="6"/>Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
    <LB number="7"/>And the firm soil win of the watery main,
    <LB number="8"/>Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
    <LB number="9"/>When I have seen such interchange of state,
    <LB number="10"/>Or state itself confounded, to decay;
    <LB number="11"/>Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
    <LB number="12"/>That Time will come and take my love away.
    <LB number="13"/>This thought is as a death which cannot choose
    <LB number="14"/>But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
    <LB number="2"/>But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
    <LB number="3"/>How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
    <LB number="4"/>Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
    <LB number="5"/>O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
    <LB number="6"/>Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
    <LB number="7"/>When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
    <LB number="8"/>Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?
    <LB number="9"/>O fearful meditation! where, alack,
    <LB number="10"/>Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
    <LB number="11"/>Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
    <LB number="12"/>Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
    <LB number="13"/>O! none, unless this miracle have might,
    <LB number="14"/>That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
    <LB number="2"/>As to behold desert a beggar born,
    <LB number="3"/>And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
    <LB number="4"/>And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
    <LB number="5"/>And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
    <LB number="6"/>And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
    <LB number="7"/>And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
    <LB number="8"/>And strength by limping sway disabled
    <LB number="9"/>And art made tongue-tied by authority,
    <LB number="10"/>And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,
    <LB number="11"/>And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
    <LB number="12"/>And captive good attending captain ill:
    <LB number="13"/>Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
    <LB number="14"/>Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
    <LB number="2"/>And with his presence grace impiety,
    <LB number="3"/>That sin by him advantage should achieve,
    <LB number="4"/>And lace itself with his society?
    <LB number="5"/>Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
    <LB number="6"/>And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
    <LB number="7"/>Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
    <LB number="8"/>Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
    <LB number="9"/>Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
    <LB number="10"/>Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
    <LB number="11"/>For she hath no exchequer now but his,
    <LB number="12"/>And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
    <LB number="13"/>O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
    <LB number="14"/>In days long since, before these last so bad.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
    <LB number="2"/>When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
    <LB number="3"/>Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
    <LB number="4"/>Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
    <LB number="5"/>Before the golden tresses of the dead,
    <LB number="6"/>The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
    <LB number="7"/>To live a second life on second head;
    <LB number="8"/>Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
    <LB number="9"/>In him those holy antique hours are seen,
    <LB number="10"/>Without all ornament, itself and true,
    <LB number="11"/>Making no summer of another's green,
    <LB number="12"/>Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
    <LB number="13"/>And him as for a map doth Nature store,
    <LB number="14"/>To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
    <LB number="2"/>Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
    <LB number="3"/>All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,
    <LB number="4"/>Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
    <LB number="5"/>Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
    <LB number="6"/>But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,
    <LB number="7"/>In other accents do this praise confound
    <LB number="8"/>By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
    <LB number="9"/>They look into the beauty of thy mind,
    <LB number="10"/>And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;
    <LB number="11"/>Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
    <LB number="12"/>To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
    <LB number="13"/>But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
    <LB number="14"/>The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
    <LB number="2"/>For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
    <LB number="3"/>The ornament of beauty is suspect,
    <LB number="4"/>A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
    <LB number="5"/>So thou be good, slander doth but approve
    <LB number="6"/>Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
    <LB number="7"/>For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
    <LB number="8"/>And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
    <LB number="9"/>Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
    <LB number="10"/>Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
    <LB number="11"/>Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
    <LB number="12"/>To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
    <LB number="13"/>If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
    <LB number="14"/>Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>No longer mourn for me when I am dead
    <LB number="2"/>Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
    <LB number="3"/>Give warning to the world that I am fled
    <LB number="4"/>From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
    <LB number="5"/>Nay, if you read this line, remember not
    <LB number="6"/>The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
    <LB number="7"/>That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
    <LB number="8"/>If thinking on me then should make you woe.
    <LB number="9"/>O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,
    <LB number="10"/>When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
    <LB number="11"/>Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
    <LB number="12"/>But let your love even with my life decay;
    <LB number="13"/>Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    <LB number="14"/>And mock you with me after I am gone.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! lest the world should task you to recite
    <LB number="2"/>What merit lived in me, that you should love
    <LB number="3"/>After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,
    <LB number="4"/>For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
    <LB number="5"/>Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
    <LB number="6"/>To do more for me than mine own desert,
    <LB number="7"/>And hang more praise upon deceased I
    <LB number="8"/>Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
    <LB number="9"/>O! lest your true love may seem false in this
    <LB number="10"/>That you for love speak well of me untrue,
    <LB number="11"/>My name be buried where my body is,
    <LB number="12"/>And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
    <LB number="13"/>For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
    <LB number="14"/>And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>That time of year thou mayst in me behold
    <LB number="2"/>When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
    <LB number="3"/>Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
    <LB number="4"/>Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
    <LB number="5"/>In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
    <LB number="6"/>As after sunset fadeth in the west;
    <LB number="7"/>Which by and by black night doth take away,
    <LB number="8"/>Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
    <LB number="9"/>In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
    <LB number="10"/>That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
    <LB number="11"/>As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
    <LB number="12"/>Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
    <LB number="13"/>This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    <LB number="14"/>To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>But be contented: when that fell arrest
    <LB number="2"/>Without all bail shall carry me away,
    <LB number="3"/>My life hath in this line some interest,
    <LB number="4"/>Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
    <LB number="5"/>When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
    <LB number="6"/>The very part was consecrate to thee:
    <LB number="7"/>The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
    <LB number="8"/>My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
    <LB number="9"/>So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
    <LB number="10"/>The prey of worms, my body being dead;
    <LB number="11"/>The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
    <LB number="12"/>Too base of thee to be remembered.
    <LB number="13"/>The worth of that is that which it contains,
    <LB number="14"/>And that is this, and this with thee remains.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
    <LB number="2"/>Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
    <LB number="3"/>And for the peace of you I hold such strife
    <LB number="4"/>As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
    <LB number="5"/>Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
    <LB number="6"/>Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
    <LB number="7"/>Now counting best to be with you alone,
    <LB number="8"/>Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:
    <LB number="9"/>Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
    <LB number="10"/>And by and by clean starved for a look;
    <LB number="11"/>Possessing or pursuing no delight,
    <LB number="12"/>Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    <LB number="13"/>Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
    <LB number="14"/>Or gluttoning on all, or all away.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
    <LB number="2"/>So far from variation or quick change?
    <LB number="3"/>Why with the time do I not glance aside
    <LB number="4"/>To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
    <LB number="5"/>Why write I still all one, ever the same,
    <LB number="6"/>And keep invention in a noted weed,
    <LB number="7"/>That every word doth almost tell my name,
    <LB number="8"/>Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
    <LB number="9"/>O! know sweet love I always write of you,
    <LB number="10"/>And you and love are still my argument;
    <LB number="11"/>So all my best is dressing old words new,
    <LB number="12"/>Spending again what is already spent:
    <LB number="13"/>For as the sun is daily new and old,
    <LB number="14"/>So is my love still telling what is told.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
    <LB number="2"/>Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
    <LB number="3"/>These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
    <LB number="4"/>And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
    <LB number="5"/>The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
    <LB number="6"/>Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
    <LB number="7"/>Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
    <LB number="8"/>Time's thievish progress to eternity.
    <LB number="9"/>Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
    <LB number="10"/>Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
    <LB number="11"/>Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
    <LB number="12"/>To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    <LB number="13"/>These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    <LB number="14"/>Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,
    <LB number="2"/>And found such fair assistance in my verse
    <LB number="3"/>As every alien pen hath got my use
    <LB number="4"/>And under thee their poesy disperse.
    <LB number="5"/>Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
    <LB number="6"/>And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
    <LB number="7"/>Have added feathers to the learned's wing
    <LB number="8"/>And given grace a double majesty.
    <LB number="9"/>Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
    <LB number="10"/>Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:
    <LB number="11"/>In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
    <LB number="12"/>And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
    <LB number="13"/>But thou art all my art, and dost advance
    <LB number="14"/>As high as learning, my rude ignorance.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
    <LB number="2"/>My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
    <LB number="3"/>But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
    <LB number="4"/>And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
    <LB number="5"/>I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
    <LB number="6"/>Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;
    <LB number="7"/>Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
    <LB number="8"/>He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
    <LB number="9"/>He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
    <LB number="10"/>From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
    <LB number="11"/>And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
    <LB number="12"/>No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
    <LB number="13"/>Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
    <LB number="14"/>Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! how I faint when I of you do write,
    <LB number="2"/>Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
    <LB number="3"/>And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
    <LB number="4"/>To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!
    <LB number="5"/>But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--
    <LB number="6"/>The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
    <LB number="7"/>My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
    <LB number="8"/>On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
    <LB number="9"/>Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
    <LB number="10"/>Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
    <LB number="11"/>Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,
    <LB number="12"/>He of tall building, and of goodly pride:
    <LB number="13"/>Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
    <LB number="14"/>The worst was this,--my love was my decay.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
    <LB number="2"/>Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
    <LB number="3"/>From hence your memory death cannot take,
    <LB number="4"/>Although in me each part will be forgotten.
    <LB number="5"/>Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
    <LB number="6"/>Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
    <LB number="7"/>The earth can yield me but a common grave,
    <LB number="8"/>When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
    <LB number="9"/>Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
    <LB number="10"/>Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;
    <LB number="11"/>And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
    <LB number="12"/>When all the breathers of this world are dead;
    <LB number="13"/>You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--
    <LB number="14"/>Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
    <LB number="2"/>And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
    <LB number="3"/>The dedicated words which writers use
    <LB number="4"/>Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
    <LB number="5"/>Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
    <LB number="6"/>Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
    <LB number="7"/>And therefore art enforced to seek anew
    <LB number="8"/>Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
    <LB number="9"/>And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
    <LB number="10"/>What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
    <LB number="11"/>Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
    <LB number="12"/>In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;
    <LB number="13"/>And their gross painting might be better us'd
    <LB number="14"/>Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>I never saw that you did painting need,
    <LB number="2"/>And therefore to your fair no painting set;
    <LB number="3"/>I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
    <LB number="4"/>That barren tender of a poet's debt:
    <LB number="5"/>And therefore have I slept in your report,
    <LB number="6"/>That you yourself, being extant, well might show
    <LB number="7"/>How far a modern quill doth come too short,
    <LB number="8"/>Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
    <LB number="9"/>This silence for my sin you did impute,
    <LB number="10"/>Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
    <LB number="11"/>For I impair not beauty being mute,
    <LB number="12"/>When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
    <LB number="13"/>There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
    <LB number="14"/>Than both your poets can in praise devise.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Who is it that says most, which can say more,
    <LB number="2"/>Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?
    <LB number="3"/>In whose confine immured is the store
    <LB number="4"/>Which should example where your equal grew.
    <LB number="5"/>Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
    <LB number="6"/>That to his subject lends not some small glory;
    <LB number="7"/>But he that writes of you, if he can tell
    <LB number="8"/>That you are you, so dignifies his story,
    <LB number="9"/>Let him but copy what in you is writ,
    <LB number="10"/>Not making worse what nature made so clear,
    <LB number="11"/>And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
    <LB number="12"/>Making his style admired every where.
    <LB number="13"/>You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
    <LB number="14"/>Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
    <LB number="2"/>While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
    <LB number="3"/>Reserve their character with golden quill,
    <LB number="4"/>And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
    <LB number="5"/>I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
    <LB number="6"/>And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
    <LB number="7"/>To every hymn that able spirit affords,
    <LB number="8"/>In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
    <LB number="9"/>Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
    <LB number="10"/>And to the most of praise add something more;
    <LB number="11"/>But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
    <LB number="12"/>Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
    <LB number="13"/>Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    <LB number="14"/>Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
    <LB number="2"/>Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
    <LB number="3"/>That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
    <LB number="4"/>Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
    <LB number="5"/>Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
    <LB number="6"/>Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
    <LB number="7"/>No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
    <LB number="8"/>Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
    <LB number="9"/>He, nor that affable familiar ghost
    <LB number="10"/>Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
    <LB number="11"/>As victors of my silence cannot boast;
    <LB number="12"/>I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    <LB number="13"/>But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
    <LB number="14"/>Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
    <LB number="2"/>And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
    <LB number="3"/>The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
    <LB number="4"/>My bonds in thee are all determinate.
    <LB number="5"/>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
    <LB number="6"/>And for that riches where is my deserving?
    <LB number="7"/>The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
    <LB number="8"/>And so my patent back again is swerving.
    <LB number="9"/>Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
    <LB number="10"/>Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
    <LB number="11"/>So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
    <LB number="12"/>Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    <LB number="13"/>Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
    <LB number="14"/>In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
    <LB number="2"/>And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
    <LB number="3"/>Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
    <LB number="4"/>And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
    <LB number="5"/>With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
    <LB number="6"/>Upon thy part I can set down a story
    <LB number="7"/>Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
    <LB number="8"/>That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
    <LB number="9"/>And I by this will be a gainer too;
    <LB number="10"/>For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
    <LB number="11"/>The injuries that to myself I do,
    <LB number="12"/>Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    <LB number="13"/>Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    <LB number="14"/>That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
    <LB number="2"/>And I will comment upon that offence:
    <LB number="3"/>Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
    <LB number="4"/>Against thy reasons making no defence.
    <LB number="5"/>Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
    <LB number="6"/>To set a form upon desired change,
    <LB number="7"/>As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
    <LB number="8"/>I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
    <LB number="9"/>Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
    <LB number="10"/>Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
    <LB number="11"/>Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
    <LB number="12"/>And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    <LB number="13"/>For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
    <LB number="14"/>For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
    <LB number="2"/>Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
    <LB number="3"/>Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
    <LB number="4"/>And do not drop in for an after-loss:
    <LB number="5"/>Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
    <LB number="6"/>Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
    <LB number="7"/>Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
    <LB number="8"/>To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.
    <LB number="9"/>If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
    <LB number="10"/>When other petty griefs have done their spite,
    <LB number="11"/>But in the onset come: so shall I taste
    <LB number="12"/>At first the very worst of fortune's might;
    <LB number="13"/>And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
    <LB number="14"/>Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
    <LB number="2"/>Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
    <LB number="3"/>Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;
    <LB number="4"/>Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
    <LB number="5"/>And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
    <LB number="6"/>Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
    <LB number="7"/>But these particulars are not my measure,
    <LB number="8"/>All these I better in one general best.
    <LB number="9"/>Thy love is better than high birth to me,
    <LB number="10"/>Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
    <LB number="11"/>Of more delight than hawks and horses be;
    <LB number="12"/>And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
    <LB number="13"/>Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
    <LB number="14"/>All this away, and me most wretchcd make.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
    <LB number="2"/>For term of life thou art assured mine;
    <LB number="3"/>And life no longer than thy love will stay,
    <LB number="4"/>For it depends upon that love of thine.
    <LB number="5"/>Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
    <LB number="6"/>When in the least of them my life hath end.
    <LB number="7"/>I see a better state to me belongs
    <LB number="8"/>Than that which on thy humour doth depend:
    <LB number="9"/>Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
    <LB number="10"/>Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
    <LB number="11"/>O! what a happy title do I find,
    <LB number="12"/>Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
    <LB number="13"/>But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
    <LB number="14"/>Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
    <LB number="2"/>Like a deceived husband; so love's face
    <LB number="3"/>May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
    <LB number="4"/>Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
    <LB number="5"/>For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
    <LB number="6"/>Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
    <LB number="7"/>In many's looks, the false heart's history
    <LB number="8"/>Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.
    <LB number="9"/>But heaven in thy creation did decree
    <LB number="10"/>That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
    <LB number="11"/>Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
    <LB number="12"/>Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
    <LB number="13"/>How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
    <LB number="14"/>If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
    <LB number="2"/>That do not do the thing they most do show,
    <LB number="3"/>Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
    <LB number="4"/>Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;
    <LB number="5"/>They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
    <LB number="6"/>And husband nature's riches from expense;
    <LB number="7"/>They are the lords and owners of their faces,
    <LB number="8"/>Others, but stewards of their excellence.
    <LB number="9"/>The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
    <LB number="10"/>Though to itself, it only live and die,
    <LB number="11"/>But if that flower with base infection meet,
    <LB number="12"/>The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
    <LB number="13"/>For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
    <LB number="14"/>Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
    <LB number="2"/>Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
    <LB number="3"/>Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
    <LB number="4"/>O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.
    <LB number="5"/>That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
    <LB number="6"/>Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
    <LB number="7"/>Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;
    <LB number="8"/>Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
    <LB number="9"/>O! what a mansion have those vices got
    <LB number="10"/>Which for their habitation chose out thee,
    <LB number="11"/>Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
    <LB number="12"/>And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
    <LB number="13"/>Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
    <LB number="14"/>The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
    <LB number="2"/>Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
    <LB number="3"/>Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:
    <LB number="4"/>Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
    <LB number="5"/>As on the finger of a throned queen
    <LB number="6"/>The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
    <LB number="7"/>So are those errors that in thee are seen
    <LB number="8"/>To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.
    <LB number="9"/>How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
    <LB number="10"/>If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
    <LB number="11"/>How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
    <LB number="12"/>if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
    <LB number="13"/>But do not so; I love thee in such sort,
    <LB number="14"/>As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>How like a winter hath my absence been
    <LB number="2"/>From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
    <LB number="3"/>What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
    <LB number="4"/>What old December's bareness everywhere!
    <LB number="5"/>And yet this time removed was summer's time;
    <LB number="6"/>The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
    <LB number="7"/>Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
    <LB number="8"/>Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
    <LB number="9"/>Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
    <LB number="10"/>But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;
    <LB number="11"/>For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
    <LB number="12"/>And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
    <LB number="13"/>Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
    <LB number="14"/>That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>From you have I been absent in the spring,
    <LB number="2"/>When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,
    <LB number="3"/>Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
    <LB number="4"/>That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
    <LB number="5"/>Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
    <LB number="6"/>Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
    <LB number="7"/>Could make me any summer's story tell,
    <LB number="8"/>Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
    <LB number="9"/>Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
    <LB number="10"/>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
    <LB number="11"/>They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
    <LB number="12"/>Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
    <LB number="13"/>Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,
    <LB number="14"/>As with your shadow I with these did play.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>The forward violet thus did I chide:
    <LB number="2"/>Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
    <LB number="3"/>If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
    <LB number="4"/>Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
    <LB number="5"/>In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.
    <LB number="6"/>The lily I condemned for thy hand,
    <LB number="7"/>And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
    <LB number="8"/>The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
    <LB number="9"/>One blushing shame, another white despair;
    <LB number="10"/>A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
    <LB number="11"/>And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
    <LB number="12"/>But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
    <LB number="13"/>A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
    <LB number="14"/>More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
    <LB number="15"/>But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
    <LB number="2"/>To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
    <LB number="3"/>Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
    <LB number="4"/>Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
    <LB number="5"/>Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
    <LB number="6"/>In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
    <LB number="7"/>Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
    <LB number="8"/>And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
    <LB number="9"/>Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
    <LB number="10"/>If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
    <LB number="11"/>If any, be a satire to decay,
    <LB number="12"/>And make time's spoils despised every where.
    <LB number="13"/>Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
    <LB number="14"/>So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
    <LB number="2"/>For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?
    <LB number="3"/>Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
    <LB number="4"/>So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
    <LB number="5"/>Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say, 'Truth needs no colour, with his colour
    fix'd; <LB number="6"/>Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
    <LB number="7"/>But best is best, if never intermix'd'?
    <LB number="8"/>Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
    <LB number="9"/>Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee
    <LB number="10"/>To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
    <LB number="11"/>And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.
    <LB number="12"/>Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
    <LB number="13"/>To make him seem long hence as he shows now.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
    <LB number="2"/>I love not less, though less the show appear;
    <LB number="3"/>That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
    <LB number="4"/>The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
    <LB number="5"/>Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
    <LB number="6"/>When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
    <LB number="7"/>As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
    <LB number="8"/>And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
    <LB number="9"/>Not that the summer is less pleasant now
    <LB number="10"/>Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
    <LB number="11"/>But that wild music burthens every bough,
    <LB number="12"/>And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
    <LB number="13"/>Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
    <LB number="14"/>Because I would not dull you with my song.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
    <LB number="2"/>That having such a scope to show her pride,
    <LB number="3"/>The argument, all bare, is of more worth
    <LB number="4"/>Than when it hath my added praise beside!
    <LB number="5"/>O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
    <LB number="6"/>Look in your glass, and there appears a face
    <LB number="7"/>That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
    <LB number="8"/>Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
    <LB number="9"/>Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
    <LB number="10"/>To mar the subject that before was well?
    <LB number="11"/>For to no other pass my verses tend
    <LB number="12"/>Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
    <LB number="13"/>And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
    <LB number="14"/>Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
    <LB number="2"/>For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,
    <LB number="3"/>Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,
    <LB number="4"/>Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
    <LB number="5"/>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
    <LB number="6"/>In process of the seasons have I seen,
    <LB number="7"/>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
    <LB number="8"/>Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
    <LB number="9"/>Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,
    <LB number="10"/>Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;
    <LB number="11"/>So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
    <LB number="12"/>Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:
    <LB number="13"/>For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
    <LB number="14"/>Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
    <LB number="2"/>Nor my beloved as an idol show,
    <LB number="3"/>Since all alike my songs and praises be
    <LB number="4"/>To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
    <LB number="5"/>Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
    <LB number="6"/>Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
    <LB number="7"/>Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,
    <LB number="8"/>One thing expressing, leaves out difference. 'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my
    argument, 'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words; <LB number="9"/>And in this change is my
      invention spent,
    <LB number="10"/>Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
    <LB number="11"/>Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,
    <LB number="12"/>Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When in the chronicle of wasted time
    <LB number="2"/>I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
    <LB number="3"/>And beauty making beautiful old rime,
    <LB number="4"/>In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
    <LB number="5"/>Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
    <LB number="6"/>Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
    <LB number="7"/>I see their antique pen would have express'd
    <LB number="8"/>Even such a beauty as you master now.
    <LB number="9"/>So all their praises are but prophecies
    <LB number="10"/>Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
    <LB number="11"/>And for they looked but with divining eyes,
    <LB number="12"/>They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
    <LB number="13"/>For we, which now behold these present days,
    <LB number="14"/>Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
    <LB number="2"/>Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
    <LB number="3"/>Can yet the lease of my true love control,
    <LB number="4"/>Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
    <LB number="5"/>The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
    <LB number="6"/>And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
    <LB number="7"/>Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
    <LB number="8"/>And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
    <LB number="9"/>Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
    <LB number="10"/>My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
    <LB number="11"/>Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
    <LB number="12"/>While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
    <LB number="13"/>And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    <LB number="14"/>When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>What's in the brain, that ink may character,
    <LB number="2"/>Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?
    <LB number="3"/>What's new to speak, what now to register,
    <LB number="4"/>That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
    <LB number="5"/>Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
    <LB number="6"/>I must each day say o'er the very same;
    <LB number="7"/>Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
    <LB number="8"/>Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
    <LB number="9"/>So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
    <LB number="10"/>Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
    <LB number="11"/>Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
    <LB number="12"/>But makes antiquity for aye his page;
    <LB number="13"/>Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
    <LB number="14"/>Where time and outward form would show it dead.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! never say that I was false of heart,
    <LB number="2"/>Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,
    <LB number="3"/>As easy might I from my self depart
    <LB number="4"/>As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
    <LB number="5"/>That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,
    <LB number="6"/>Like him that travels, I return again;
    <LB number="7"/>Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,
    <LB number="8"/>So that myself bring water for my stain.
    <LB number="9"/>Never believe though in my nature reign'd,
    <LB number="10"/>All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
    <LB number="11"/>That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
    <LB number="12"/>To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
    <LB number="13"/>For nothing this wide universe I call,
    <LB number="14"/>Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
    <LB number="2"/>And made my self a motley to the view,
    <LB number="3"/>Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
    <LB number="4"/>Made old offences of affections new;
    <LB number="5"/>Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
    <LB number="6"/>Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
    <LB number="7"/>These blenches gave my heart another youth,
    <LB number="8"/>And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
    <LB number="9"/>Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
    <LB number="10"/>Mine appetite I never more will grind
    <LB number="11"/>On newer proof, to try an older friend,
    <LB number="12"/>A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
    <LB number="13"/>Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
    <LB number="14"/>Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
    <LB number="2"/>The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
    <LB number="3"/>That did not better for my life provide
    <LB number="4"/>Than public means which public manners breeds.
    <LB number="5"/>Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
    <LB number="6"/>And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
    <LB number="7"/>To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
    <LB number="8"/>Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;
    <LB number="9"/>Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,
    <LB number="10"/>Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
    <LB number="11"/>No bitterness that I will bitter think,
    <LB number="12"/>Nor double penance, to correct correction.
    <LB number="13"/>Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
    <LB number="14"/>Even that your pity is enough to cure me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
    <LB number="2"/>Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
    <LB number="3"/>For what care I who calls me well or ill,
    <LB number="4"/>So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
    <LB number="5"/>You are my all-the-world, and I must strive
    <LB number="6"/>To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
    <LB number="7"/>None else to me, nor I to none alive,
    <LB number="8"/>That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
    <LB number="9"/>In so profound abysm I throw all care
    <LB number="10"/>Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
    <LB number="11"/>To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
    <LB number="12"/>Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
    <LB number="13"/>You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
    <LB number="14"/>That all the world besides methinks are dead.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
    <LB number="2"/>And that which governs me to go about
    <LB number="3"/>Doth part his function and is partly blind,
    <LB number="4"/>Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
    <LB number="5"/>For it no form delivers to the heart
    <LB number="6"/>Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:
    <LB number="7"/>Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
    <LB number="8"/>Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
    <LB number="9"/>For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
    <LB number="10"/>The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
    <LB number="11"/>The mountain or the sea, the day or night:
    <LB number="12"/>The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
    <LB number="13"/>Incapable of more, replete with you,
    <LB number="14"/>My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
    <LB number="2"/>Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
    <LB number="3"/>Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
    <LB number="4"/>And that your love taught it this alchemy,
    <LB number="5"/>To make of monsters and things indigest
    <LB number="6"/>Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
    <LB number="7"/>Creating every bad a perfect best,
    <LB number="8"/>As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
    <LB number="9"/>O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
    <LB number="10"/>And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
    <LB number="11"/>Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
    <LB number="12"/>And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
    <LB number="13"/>If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
    <LB number="14"/>That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
    <LB number="2"/>Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
    <LB number="3"/>Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
    <LB number="4"/>My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
    <LB number="5"/>But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
    <LB number="6"/>Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
    <LB number="7"/>Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
    <LB number="8"/>Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
    <LB number="9"/>Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
    <LB number="10"/>Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'
    <LB number="11"/>When I was certain o'er incertainty,
    <LB number="12"/>Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
    <LB number="13"/>Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
    <LB number="14"/>To give full growth to that which still doth grow?

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Let me not to the marriage of true minds
    <LB number="2"/>Admit impediments. Love is not love
    <LB number="3"/>Which alters when it alteration finds,
    <LB number="4"/>Or bends with the remover to remove:
    <LB number="5"/>O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
    <LB number="6"/>That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
    <LB number="7"/>It is the star to every wandering bark,
    <LB number="8"/>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
    <LB number="9"/>Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
    <LB number="10"/>Within his bending sickle's compass come;
    <LB number="11"/>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
    <LB number="12"/>But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
    <LB number="13"/>If this be error and upon me prov'd,
    <LB number="14"/>I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,
    <LB number="2"/>Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
    <LB number="3"/>Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
    <LB number="4"/>Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
    <LB number="5"/>That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
    <LB number="6"/>And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;
    <LB number="7"/>That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
    <LB number="8"/>Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
    <LB number="9"/>Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
    <LB number="10"/>And on just proof surmise, accumulate;
    <LB number="11"/>Bring me within the level of your frown,
    <LB number="12"/>But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
    <LB number="13"/>Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
    <LB number="14"/>The constancy and virtue of your love.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
    <LB number="2"/>With eager compounds we our palate urge;
    <LB number="3"/>As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
    <LB number="4"/>We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
    <LB number="5"/>Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
    <LB number="6"/>To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
    <LB number="7"/>And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
    <LB number="8"/>To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
    <LB number="9"/>Thus policy in love, to anticipate
    <LB number="10"/>The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,
    <LB number="11"/>And brought to medicine a healthful state
    <LB number="12"/>Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;
    <LB number="13"/>But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
    <LB number="14"/>Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
    <LB number="2"/>Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
    <LB number="3"/>Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
    <LB number="4"/>Still losing when I saw myself to win!
    <LB number="5"/>What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
    <LB number="6"/>Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
    <LB number="7"/>How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,
    <LB number="8"/>In the distraction of this madding fever!
    <LB number="9"/>O benefit of ill! now I find true
    <LB number="10"/>That better is, by evil still made better;
    <LB number="11"/>And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
    <LB number="12"/>Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
    <LB number="13"/>So I return rebuk'd to my content,
    <LB number="14"/>And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>That you were once unkind befriends me now,
    <LB number="2"/>And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
    <LB number="3"/>Needs must I under my transgression bow,
    <LB number="4"/>Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
    <LB number="5"/>For if you were by my unkindness shaken,
    <LB number="6"/>As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;
    <LB number="7"/>And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
    <LB number="8"/>To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
    <LB number="9"/>O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
    <LB number="10"/>My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
    <LB number="11"/>And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
    <LB number="12"/>The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
    <LB number="13"/>But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
    <LB number="14"/>Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd, 
    <LB number="2"/>When not to be receives reproach of being;
    <LB number="3"/>And the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd
    <LB number="4"/>Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:
    <LB number="5"/>For why should others' false adulterate eyes
    <LB number="6"/>Give salutation to my sportive blood?
    <LB number="7"/>Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
    <LB number="8"/>Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
    <LB number="9"/>No, I am that I am, and they that level
    <LB number="10"/>At my abuses reckon up their own:
    <LB number="11"/>I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
    <LB number="12"/>By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;
    <LB number="13"/>Unless this general evil they maintain,
    <LB number="14"/>All men are bad and in their badness reign.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
    <LB number="2"/>Full character'd with lasting memory,
    <LB number="3"/>Which shall above that idle rank remain,
    <LB number="4"/>Beyond all date; even to eternity:
    <LB number="5"/>Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart
    <LB number="6"/>Have faculty by nature to subsist;
    <LB number="7"/>Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part
    <LB number="8"/>Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
    <LB number="9"/>That poor retention could not so much hold,
    <LB number="10"/>Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
    <LB number="11"/>Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
    <LB number="12"/>To trust those tables that receive thee more:
    <LB number="13"/>To keep an adjunct to remember thee
    <LB number="14"/>Were to import forgetfulness in me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
    <LB number="2"/>Thy pyramids built up with newer might
    <LB number="3"/>To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
    <LB number="4"/>They are but dressings of a former sight.
    <LB number="5"/>Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
    <LB number="6"/>What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
    <LB number="7"/>And rather make them born to our desire
    <LB number="8"/>Than think that we before have heard them told.
    <LB number="9"/>Thy registers and thee I both defy,
    <LB number="10"/>Not wondering at the present nor the past,
    <LB number="11"/>For thy records and what we see doth lie,
    <LB number="12"/>Made more or less by thy continual haste.
    <LB number="13"/>This I do vow and this shall ever be;
    <LB number="14"/>I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>If my dear love were but the child of state,
    <LB number="2"/>It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,
    <LB number="3"/>As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
    <LB number="4"/>Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
    <LB number="5"/>No, it was builded far from accident;
    <LB number="6"/>It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
    <LB number="7"/>Under the blow of thralled discontent,
    <LB number="8"/>Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
    <LB number="9"/>It fears not policy, that heretic,
    <LB number="10"/>Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
    <LB number="11"/>But all alone stands hugely politic,
    <LB number="12"/>That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
    <LB number="13"/>To this I witness call the fools of time,
    <LB number="14"/>Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
    <LB number="2"/>With my extern the outward honouring,
    <LB number="3"/>Or laid great bases for eternity,
    <LB number="4"/>Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
    <LB number="5"/>Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
    <LB number="6"/>Lose all and more by paying too much rent
    <LB number="7"/>For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
    <LB number="8"/>Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
    <LB number="9"/>No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
    <LB number="10"/>And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
    <LB number="11"/>Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
    <LB number="12"/>But mutual render, only me for thee.
    <LB number="13"/>Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
    <LB number="14"/>When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
    <LB number="2"/>Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;
    <LB number="3"/>Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
    <LB number="4"/>Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
    <LB number="5"/>If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
    <LB number="6"/>As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
    <LB number="7"/>She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
    <LB number="8"/>May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
    <LB number="9"/>Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
    <LB number="10"/>She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
    <LB number="11"/>Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
    <LB number="12"/>And her quietus is to render thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>In the old age black was not counted fair,
    <LB number="2"/>Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
    <LB number="3"/>But now is black beauty's successive heir,
    <LB number="4"/>And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
    <LB number="5"/>For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,
    <LB number="6"/>Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,
    <LB number="7"/>Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
    <LB number="8"/>But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.
    <LB number="9"/>Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
    <LB number="10"/>Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
    <LB number="11"/>At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
    <LB number="12"/>Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:
    <LB number="13"/>Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
    <LB number="14"/>That every tongue says beauty should look so.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
    <LB number="2"/>Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
    <LB number="3"/>With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
    <LB number="4"/>The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
    <LB number="5"/>Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
    <LB number="6"/>To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
    <LB number="7"/>Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
    <LB number="8"/>At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
    <LB number="9"/>To be so tickled, they would change their state
    <LB number="10"/>And situation with those dancing chips,
    <LB number="11"/>O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
    <LB number="12"/>Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.
    <LB number="13"/>Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
    <LB number="14"/>Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
    <LB number="2"/>Is lust in action: and till action, lust
    <LB number="3"/>Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
    <LB number="4"/>Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
    <LB number="5"/>Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
    <LB number="6"/>Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
    <LB number="7"/>Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
    <LB number="8"/>On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
    <LB number="9"/>Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
    <LB number="10"/>Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;
    <LB number="11"/>A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;
    <LB number="12"/>Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
    <LB number="13"/>All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
    <LB number="14"/>To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
    <LB number="2"/>Coral is far more red, than her lips red:
    <LB number="3"/>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
    <LB number="4"/>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
    <LB number="5"/>I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
    <LB number="6"/>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
    <LB number="7"/>And in some perfumes is there more delight
    <LB number="8"/>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
    <LB number="9"/>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
    <LB number="10"/>That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
    <LB number="11"/>I grant I never saw a goddess go,--
    <LB number="12"/>My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
    <LB number="13"/>And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,
    <LB number="14"/>As any she belied with false compare.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
    <LB number="2"/>As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
    <LB number="3"/>For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
    <LB number="4"/>Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
    <LB number="5"/>Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,
    <LB number="6"/>Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
    <LB number="7"/>To say they err I dare not be so bold,
    <LB number="8"/>Although I swear it to myself alone.
    <LB number="9"/>And to be sure that is not false I swear,
    <LB number="10"/>A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
    <LB number="11"/>One on another's neck, do witness bear
    <LB number="12"/>Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
    <LB number="13"/>In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
    <LB number="14"/>And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
    <LB number="2"/>Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
    <LB number="3"/>Have put on black and loving mourners be,
    <LB number="4"/>Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
    <LB number="5"/>And truly not the morning sun of heaven
    <LB number="6"/>Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
    <LB number="7"/>Nor that full star that ushers in the even,
    <LB number="8"/>Doth half that glory to the sober west,
    <LB number="9"/>As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
    <LB number="10"/>O! let it then as well beseem thy heart
    <LB number="11"/>To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
    <LB number="12"/>And suit thy pity like in every part.
    <LB number="13"/>Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
    <LB number="14"/>And all they foul that thy complexion lack.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
    <LB number="2"/>For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
    <LB number="3"/>Is't not enough to torture me alone,
    <LB number="4"/>But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
    <LB number="5"/>Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
    <LB number="6"/>And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
    <LB number="7"/>Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;
    <LB number="8"/>A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd:
    <LB number="9"/>Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
    <LB number="10"/>But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
    <LB number="11"/>Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
    <LB number="12"/>Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:
    <LB number="13"/>And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
    <LB number="14"/>Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
    <LB number="2"/>And I my self am mortgag'd to thy will,
    <LB number="3"/>Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
    <LB number="4"/>Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
    <LB number="5"/>But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
    <LB number="6"/>For thou art covetous, and he is kind;
    <LB number="7"/>He learn'd but surety-like to write for me,
    <LB number="8"/>Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
    <LB number="9"/>The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
    <LB number="10"/>Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use,
    <LB number="11"/>And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
    <LB number="12"/>So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
    <LB number="13"/>Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
    <LB number="14"/>He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'
    <LB number="2"/>And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus;
    <LB number="3"/>More than enough am I that vex'd thee still,
    <LB number="4"/>To thy sweet will making addition thus.
    <LB number="5"/>Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
    <LB number="6"/>Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
    <LB number="7"/>Shall will in others seem right gracious,
    <LB number="8"/>And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
    <LB number="9"/>The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,
    <LB number="10"/>And in abundance addeth to his store;
    <LB number="11"/>So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
    <LB number="12"/>One will of mine, to make thy large will more.
    <LB number="13"/>Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill;
    <LB number="14"/>Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
    <LB number="2"/>Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
    <LB number="3"/>And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
    <LB number="4"/>Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil. 'Will', will fulfil the treasure of
    thy love, <LB number="5"/>Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
    <LB number="6"/>In things of great receipt with ease we prove
    <LB number="7"/>Among a number one is reckon'd none:
    <LB number="8"/>Then in the number let me pass untold,
    <LB number="9"/>Though in thy store's account I one must be;
    <LB number="10"/>For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
    <LB number="11"/>That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
    <LB number="12"/>Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
    <LB number="13"/>And then thou lov'st me for my name is 'Will.'
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
    <LB number="2"/>That they behold, and see not what they see?
    <LB number="3"/>They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
    <LB number="4"/>Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
    <LB number="5"/>If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
    <LB number="6"/>Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
    <LB number="7"/>Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
    <LB number="8"/>Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
    <LB number="9"/>Why should my heart think that a several plot,
    <LB number="10"/>Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
    <LB number="11"/>Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
    <LB number="12"/>To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
    <LB number="13"/>In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
    <LB number="14"/>And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>When my love swears that she is made of truth,
    <LB number="2"/>I do believe her though I know she lies,
    <LB number="3"/>That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
    <LB number="4"/>Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
    <LB number="5"/>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
    <LB number="6"/>Although she knows my days are past the best,
    <LB number="7"/>Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
    <LB number="8"/>On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
    <LB number="9"/>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
    <LB number="10"/>And wherefore say not I that I am old?
    <LB number="11"/>O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,
    <LB number="12"/>And age in love, loves not to have years told:
    <LB number="13"/>Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
    <LB number="14"/>And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! call not me to justify the wrong
    <LB number="2"/>That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
    <LB number="3"/>Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:
    <LB number="4"/>Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
    <LB number="5"/>Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
    <LB number="6"/>Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
    <LB number="7"/>What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might
    <LB number="8"/>Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide?
    <LB number="9"/>Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
    <LB number="10"/>Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
    <LB number="11"/>And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
    <LB number="12"/>That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
    <LB number="13"/>Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
    <LB number="14"/>Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
    <LB number="2"/>My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
    <LB number="3"/>Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
    <LB number="4"/>The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
    <LB number="5"/>If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
    <LB number="6"/>Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;--
    <LB number="7"/>As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
    <LB number="8"/>No news but health from their physicians know;--
    <LB number="9"/>For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,
    <LB number="10"/>And in my madness might speak ill of thee;
    <LB number="11"/>Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
    <LB number="12"/>Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
    <LB number="13"/>That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
    <LB number="14"/>Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
    <LB number="2"/>For they in thee a thousand errors note;
    <LB number="3"/>But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
    <LB number="4"/>Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.
    <LB number="5"/>Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;
    <LB number="6"/>Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
    <LB number="7"/>Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
    <LB number="8"/>To any sensual feast with thee alone:
    <LB number="9"/>But my five wits nor my five senses can
    <LB number="10"/>Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
    <LB number="11"/>Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
    <LB number="12"/>Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
    <LB number="13"/>Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
    <LB number="14"/>That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
    <LB number="2"/>Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
    <LB number="3"/>O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,
    <LB number="4"/>And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
    <LB number="5"/>Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
    <LB number="6"/>That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments
    <LB number="7"/>And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
    <LB number="8"/>Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
    <LB number="9"/>Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those
    <LB number="10"/>Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
    <LB number="11"/>Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
    <LB number="12"/>Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
    <LB number="13"/>If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    <LB number="14"/>By self-example mayst thou be denied!

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch
    <LB number="2"/>One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
    <LB number="3"/>Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
    <LB number="4"/>In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;
    <LB number="5"/>Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
    <LB number="6"/>Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
    <LB number="7"/>To follow that which flies before her face,
    <LB number="8"/>Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
    <LB number="9"/>So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
    <LB number="10"/>Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
    <LB number="11"/>But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
    <LB number="12"/>And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;
    <LB number="13"/>So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
    <LB number="14"/>If thou turn back and my loud crying still.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
    <LB number="2"/>Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
    <LB number="3"/>The better angel is a man right fair,
    <LB number="4"/>The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
    <LB number="5"/>To win me soon to hell, my female evil,
    <LB number="6"/>Tempteth my better angel from my side,
    <LB number="7"/>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
    <LB number="8"/>Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
    <LB number="9"/>And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
    <LB number="10"/>Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
    <LB number="11"/>But being both from me, both to each friend,
    <LB number="12"/>I guess one angel in another's hell:
    <LB number="13"/>Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
    <LB number="14"/>Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
    <LB number="2"/>Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
    <LB number="3"/>To me that languish'd for her sake:
    <LB number="4"/>But when she saw my woeful state,
    <LB number="5"/>Straight in her heart did mercy come,
    <LB number="6"/>Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
    <LB number="7"/>Was us'd in giving gentle doom;
    <LB number="8"/>And taught it thus anew to greet;
    <LB number="9"/>'I hate' she alter'd with an end, 
    <LB number="10"/>That followed it as gentle day,
    <LB number="11"/>Doth follow night, who like a fiend
    <LB number="12"/>From heaven to hell is flown away.
    <LB number="13"/>'I hate', from hate away she threw, 
    <LB number="14"/>And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'.
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
    <LB number="2"/>My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
    <LB number="3"/>Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
    <LB number="4"/>Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
    <LB number="5"/>Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
    <LB number="6"/>Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
    <LB number="7"/>Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
    <LB number="8"/>Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
    <LB number="9"/>Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
    <LB number="10"/>And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
    <LB number="11"/>Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
    <LB number="12"/>Within be fed, without be rich no more:
    <LB number="13"/>So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
    <LB number="14"/>And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>My love is as a fever longing still,
    <LB number="2"/>For that which longer nurseth the disease;
    <LB number="3"/>Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
    <LB number="4"/>The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
    <LB number="5"/>My reason, the physician to my love,
    <LB number="6"/>Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
    <LB number="7"/>Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
    <LB number="8"/>Desire is death, which physic did except.
    <LB number="9"/>Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
    <LB number="10"/>And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
    <LB number="11"/>My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
    <LB number="12"/>At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    <LB number="13"/>For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    <LB number="14"/>Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
    <LB number="2"/>Which have no correspondence with true sight;
    <LB number="3"/>Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
    <LB number="4"/>That censures falsely what they see aright?
    <LB number="5"/>If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
    <LB number="6"/>What means the world to say it is not so?
    <LB number="7"/>If it be not, then love doth well denote
    <LB number="8"/>Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
    <LB number="9"/>How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
    <LB number="10"/>That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
    <LB number="11"/>No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
    <LB number="12"/>The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
    <LB number="13"/>O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
    <LB number="14"/>Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
    <LB number="2"/>When I against myself with thee partake?
    <LB number="3"/>Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
    <LB number="4"/>Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?
    <LB number="5"/>Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
    <LB number="6"/>On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
    <LB number="7"/>Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
    <LB number="8"/>Revenge upon myself with present moan?
    <LB number="9"/>What merit do I in my self respect,
    <LB number="10"/>That is so proud thy service to despise,
    <LB number="11"/>When all my best doth worship thy defect,
    <LB number="12"/>Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    <LB number="13"/>But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
    <LB number="14"/>Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,
    <LB number="2"/>With insufficiency my heart to sway?
    <LB number="3"/>To make me give the lie to my true sight,
    <LB number="4"/>And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
    <LB number="5"/>Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
    <LB number="6"/>That in the very refuse of thy deeds
    <LB number="7"/>There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
    <LB number="8"/>That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
    <LB number="9"/>Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
    <LB number="10"/>The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
    <LB number="11"/>O! though I love what others do abhor,
    <LB number="12"/>With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
    <LB number="13"/>If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
    <LB number="14"/>More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Love is too young to know what conscience is,
    <LB number="2"/>Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
    <LB number="3"/>Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
    <LB number="4"/>Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
    <LB number="5"/>For, thou betraying me, I do betray
    <LB number="6"/>My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
    <LB number="7"/>My soul doth tell my body that he may
    <LB number="8"/>Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,
    <LB number="9"/>But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
    <LB number="10"/>As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
    <LB number="11"/>He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
    <LB number="12"/>To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
    <LB number="13"/>No want of conscience hold it that I call
    <LB number="14"/>Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
    <LB number="2"/>But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
    <LB number="3"/>In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
    <LB number="4"/>In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
    <LB number="5"/>But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
    <LB number="6"/>When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;
    <LB number="7"/>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
    <LB number="8"/>And all my honest faith in thee is lost:
    <LB number="9"/>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
    <LB number="10"/>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
    <LB number="11"/>And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
    <LB number="12"/>Or made them swear against the thing they see;
    <LB number="13"/>For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
    <LB number="14"/>To swear against the truth so foul a lie!

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
    <LB number="2"/>A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
    <LB number="3"/>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
    <LB number="4"/>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
    <LB number="5"/>Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
    <LB number="6"/>A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
    <LB number="7"/>And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove
    <LB number="8"/>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
    <LB number="9"/>But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
    <LB number="10"/>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
    <LB number="11"/>I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
    <LB number="12"/>And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
    <LB number="13"/>But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
    <LB number="14"/>Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <LB number="1"/>The little Love-god lying once asleep,
    <LB number="2"/>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
    <LB number="3"/>Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
    <LB number="4"/>Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
    <LB number="5"/>The fairest votary took up that fire
    <LB number="6"/>Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
    <LB number="7"/>And so the general of hot desire
    <LB number="8"/>Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
    <LB number="9"/>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
    <LB number="10"/>Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
    <LB number="11"/>Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
    <LB number="12"/>For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
    <LB number="13"/>Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
    <LB number="14"/>Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
