An important task I want to be able to do with our project is keep track of how often different characters appear, both in panels, and how many lines they have.
So far in Issue #1, Sonic is the only character who has shown up, but it's still prudent to come up with template XPath commands we can use to sparse through different character appearences.
//cbml:balloon[@who = "#sonic"] => count() Will return the number of balloons that Sonic has, so far only 9.
//cbml:panel/@characters[contains(.,'#sonic')] => count() will return the number of panels Sonic appears in so far, 20.

A comming like:
//cbml:balloon[normalize-space() ! string-length() = max(//cbml:balloon/ normalize-space() ! string-length())]
will return the longest balloon, Sonic giving a vista resident some advice, while
//cbml:balloon[normalize-space() ! string-length() = min(//cbml:balloon/ normalize-space() ! string-length())] 
returns the shortest line, the resident agreeing saying 'O-okay!'.

I made sure to identify as many enemies as possible, within the panelDesc notes, so you can search for the number of times an Egg Hammer or a Motobug appears using commands like:
//cbml:panel/note[contains(. , 'Egg Hammer')] => count()
or 
//cbml:panel/note[contains(. , 'Motobug')] => count()
