        <line n="2">to see the leaves turning, to be surrounded</line>
        <line n="3">by leaves turning; it's not just the symbolism,</line>
        <line n="4">to confront in the death of the year your death,</line>
        <line n="5">one blazing farewell appearance, though the irony </line>

        <line n="7">so you drive in terror for literal hours and it looks </line>
        <line n="8">like rain, or snow, but it's probably just clouds</line>
        <line n="9">(too cloudy to see any color?) and you wonder, </line>
        <line n="10">given the poverty of your memory, which road had the </line>
